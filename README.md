# CorrectSpell - Chrome Extension

A silent auto-correction spell checker for web pages using nspell.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Building the Extension

The project uses webpack to bundle the background and content scripts:

1. For production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. For development (with watch mode):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will create bundled files in the `dist/` directory:
- `dist/background.bundle.js`
- `dist/content.bundle.js`

## Loading the Extension in Chrome

1. Build the extension (see above)
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
4. Click "Load unpacked" button
5. Select the extension directory (containing the manifest.json)
6. The extension should now be active

## How It Works

- The content script monitors text inputs, textareas, and contenteditable elements on web pages
- When users type, words are sent to the background script for spell checking
- If a word is misspelled, nspell provides a correction which is automatically applied
- The correction happens silently without user interaction

```

## Troubleshooting

- If the extension doesn't work, check the console in the extension's background page for errors
- Make sure to rebuild after making changes to the source files
- The extension needs to be reloaded in Chrome after each build during development

## Development

- Edit the source files (background.js and content.js)
- Run `npm run dev` to automatically rebuild on changes
- Reload the extension in Chrome to see changes
